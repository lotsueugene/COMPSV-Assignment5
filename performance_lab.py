# üîç Problem 1: Find Most Frequent Element
# Given a list of integers, return the value that appears most frequently.
# If there's a tie, return any of the most frequent.
#
# Example:
# Input: [1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3]
# Output: 3
num=[1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3]
def most_frequent(numbers):
    return max(set(numbers),key=numbers.count) #checks unique numbers using set() and uses numbers.count to count # of appearances

# print(most_frequent(num))

"""
Time and Space Analysis for problem 1:
- Best-case: All numbers are the same. Set()  gets the unique  numbers and checks through  the code once. O(n)
- Worst-case: 
- Average-case: Some numbers repeat like this problem. Set gets unique numbers and count() loops through to find number of occurances. O(n2)
- Space complexity: Uses space to store unique numbers
- Why this approach? : It is simple and readable and usues python built-in functions( max(), and couny())
- Could it be optimized? Yes, can be optimized to be O(n)
